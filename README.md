# To Do App

## Description

Welcome to the To Do App! This project is a comprehensive demonstration of task management using modern web technologies. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing your tasks with features that include creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. The app uses local storage to ensure that your tasks are saved across sessions, allowing you to keep track of your tasks seamlessly.

Local storage is a web browser feature that lets web applications store key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. This allows web apps to save data during one session, then retrieve it in a later page session. In this TODO application, you'll learn how to handle form inputs, manage local storage, perform CRUD operations on tasks, implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements.

## Features

- **Task Creation:** Add new tasks with a title, due date, and description.
- **Task Management:** Edit and delete tasks as needed.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage to retain data between sessions.
- **Dynamic UI:** The app dynamically updates the task list and provides visual feedback.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to work on various screen sizes.
